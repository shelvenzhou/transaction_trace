For development, run

> python3 -m pip install .

The package should be installed to `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages` on Linux or `$HONE/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages` on macOS. You can just replace the folder with soft link so any changes on code will take effect immediately.
